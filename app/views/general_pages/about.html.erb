      <p>
        The National Society of Collegiate Scholars is a honor organization
        that recognizes and elevates high-achieving college students.
        NSCS provides career and graduate school connections, leadership and
        service opportunities and gives out more than $1 million each year in
        scholarships, awards and chapter funds. Our members are committed to
        scholarship, leadership and service, and therefore, they are impacting
        our campus and local community every day. NSCS was founded in 1994 on
        the campus of The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
        NSCS is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and
        is a recognized organization at over 330 campuses across the country,

              In NSCS we strive to build strong leaders who

              Our social events allow members to meet fellow members and network
              outside of our society.

      <h2 class="subheader-text">As a Member</h2>
      <p>
        As a member of the Texas A&M chapter of NSCS, you will be part of a
        prestigious community of high-achieving students who exemplify scholarship,
        leadership and commitment. NSCS members are leaders on their campus
        in many, many ways. Taking the lead on academic integrity is a core
        pillar of NSCS. Each year during the second week of February, members
        nationwide host Integrity Week. Being one of Texas A&Mâ€™s core values,
        NSCS will also be hosting an additional Integrity week in the Fall.
        <br/><br/>
        Access to NSCS exclusive awards and programs are available to members,
        such as Semester at Sea, International Scholar Laureate Program,
        Absolute Internship, Make School, Future Docs Abroad and Hult
        International Business School. NSCS members give back to their
        community in various ways. In 2017, NSCS adopted Feeding America to
        support our scholars across the U.S. and Puerto Rico impacted by the
        devastation of natural disasters.
        <br/><br/>
        Recognizing the importance of mental health among college students,
        NSCS has partnered with Active Minds as its national philanthropy to
        help educate and break the stigma of stress, anxiety, depression, etc.
        NSCS chapters partner across the nation each year with local schools
        for the Planning to Achieve Collegiate Excellence Program (PACE). At
        Texas A&M, we also assist with Magnified Nursing Home, where students
        can establish lasting relationships with the community.
